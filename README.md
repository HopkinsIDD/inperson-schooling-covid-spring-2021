Code is provided to reproduce the primary in-person schooling (`1-Main-Schooling-Analysis.Rmd`) and occupation/work outside home (`2-Educators-Analysis.Rmd`) analyses using a synthetic dataset. Hence, results produced when knitting these documents will **not** match those presented in the accompanying paper. 

Data to reproduce paper figures/tables are freely available from the CMU Delphi Research Group to researchers at universities and non-profits as detailed at Getting Data Access - Delphi Epidata API (cmu-delphi.github.io).

Please reach out to jlessler[at]unc.edu if you have any questions.
